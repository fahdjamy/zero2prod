// A package is a bundle of one or more crates that provides a set of functionality

// A crate can come in one of two forms: a binary crate or a library crate.
// A package can contain as many binary crates as you like, but at most only one library crate.
// A package must contain at least one crate, whether thatâ€™s a library or binary crate.
